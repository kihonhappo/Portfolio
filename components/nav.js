                            I already had Visual Studio Code installed on my pc and I have been using it since it first came out. 
                            I had no problem with intalling node.
                            I have not used Github so this is a good but challenging process. 
                            I was able to get it set up on mu Visual Studio Code editor.
                            I am having issues with updating my gitpages for my live portfolio site.

                            I set up Git Hub Account
                            I set up my Visual Studio Code and set it up to work with Git Hub.
                            I was able to publish the Portfolio hosted page to https://kihonhappo.github.io/Portfolio/.
                            I downloaded Team Viewer and set it up for my group meatings.
                            I read through the reading material but really enjoyed the Mobile First Videos.

                        <p> 
                            I will build out my portfolio page links and start to record my notes and code examples in the subpages.
                            I will set up my css files to make my portfolio pages look nicer.

                        <p>  
                            One major blocker was that I did not read both of the anouncments and I missed the link and explanation for the Team Viewer site and group. 
                            I have a habit of quick scanning documentation and I am prone to missing important key elements. 
                            I will need to not do that when it comes to announcements.
                            I waited too late in the week to take a more detailed look at the assignments which tends to cause me stress.
                            I was planning on using vue.js framework as my basic code for my projects but then I read that you wanted us to do it from scratch. 
                            I have become so dependent on frameworks that I tend to get lazy when it comes to custom coding. This class will be good for me to brush up on my creative coding skills.

                        <p> In ch:2 concerning the primitive data types I noticed that there was a type that I have never heard of or used, the Symbol. 
                            I have been developing web applications since 2008 and haven't ran across it. 
                            I liked the tyepof special character if helps in cases where I am trying to automate the processing of data from multiple sources. 
                            I can use typeof to tell me if it is a string, number, boolean, undefined or null. I have used it to determine is an element is an object or an array as well. 
                        </p>
                         <p> I have also noticed that there is a lot more push to use let and const. I still use var most of the time hopefully it will not go away.
                        </p>  
                        <p>    In ch3 I noticed that I need to study about sets, and Maps. 
                        </p>
                        <p>  
                            In ch4 I noticed that I don't like using arrow functions, they are challenging for me visually except for when I use a filter on an array. 
                            <pre>
                                <div class="code-cont">
                                    <code class="code-box">

                                        {first_name: "Aaron", last_name: "Ameny"},{first_name: "Jack", last_name: "Smith"}]
                                        list.filter(x => x.first_name == 'Aaron')[0];

                            </pre>
                            <p>
                                This would bring back the first object with a first name of Aaron. 
                                For some reason this makes sense to me visually.

                            Erin helped us all with using Git as well as with the assignment.
                            I was able to help with some of the debugging and hopefully I didn't teach any bad habbits.
                            I was very impressed with the last example that the teacher had created where he passed functions as arguments into the calculator function.

                        <p>
                            I had to revamp my portfolio site to include much more content. 
                            I created a function in the portfolio site that checks if a localStorage item for link last clicked. 
                            If not storage item then the function defaults to the first week information. 
                            If there is a storage item then the function will get the content associated with the storage item. 
                            If a link is clicked then the localStorage will be set to the week selected and then the function injects the associated content into the web page. 
                            I was able to learn how to sync my VS code with Github to push site code to the repository. 
                            I was also able to update my Github pages. I added last weeks report and ninja example to my week 1 portfolio page. 
                            I had a successful Team meeting with my group. We were able to help each other with the Team Assignment.

                        <p> 
                            I am going to complete the week 2 page of my portfolio and start on week 3 of my portfolio. 
                            I will spend more time on the exercises and do some extra reading.

                        <p>  
                            Time is a blocker and timing is as well. 
                            It can be a bit discouraging to come home after work and then put in several hours of homework and then realize that my whole evening is gone. 
                            I need to read more on Sunday and Monday evening.

                                An object in JavaScript is a self-contained set of related values and functions. 
                                They act as a collection of named properties that map to any JavaScript value such as strings, 
                                numbers, booleans, arrays and functions. If a property’s value is a function, it is known as a method.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One way to think about an object is that it’s like a dictionary where you look up a property name 
                                and see a value. It's like a database of values (in fact, some databases use JavaScript objects to 
                                store information). JavaScript objects are similar to a hash or associative array in other programming 
                                languages (or even a JavaScript map ). They are, however, much more flexible, as they can be employed to 
                                encapsulate code that can be reused throughout a program. They can also inherit properties from other 
                                objects in a similar way to object-oriented languages.         
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Objects are often used to keep any related information and functionality together in the same place. 
                                For example, if you wrote functions that found the perimeter and area of a square, you might want to 
                                group them together as methods of the same object that also included a length property.

                                The ability to create objects with computed property keys was introduced in ES6. This means that 
                                JavaScript code can be placed inside square brackets and the property key will be the return value of 
                                that code. This can be seen in the example below where the + operator is used to concatenate the 
                                strings 'catch' and 'phrase':
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The value of a property has always been allowed to be a JavaScript expression. 
                                In the example below a ternary operator is used to return a true or false value for the hero property 
                                depending on the value of the bewitched variable:

                                We can loop through all of an object’s properties and methods by using a for in loop. For example,

                                We can loop through all of an object’s properties and methods by using a for in loop. For example, 
                                to log all the properties of the superman object to the console, we could use:
                            </p>

                            <p> In ch:2 concerning the primitive data types I noticed that there was a type that I have never heard of or used, the Symbol. 
                                I have been developing web applications since 2008 and haven't ran across it. 
                                I liked the tyepof special character if helps in cases where I am trying to automate the processing of data from multiple sources. 
                                I can use typeof to tell me if it is a string, number, boolean, undefined or null. I have used it to determine is an element is an object or an array as well.

                            I did more tutorials on GitHub and am now much more comfortable with commiting and uploading code changes to the GitPages
                            where my Portfolio is hosted. I have not used sub version software in the past so this is a great experience for me to 
                            broaden my resume and to better streamline my coding practices.

                            Group 4 met on Wednesday 5/5/2021 from 7:45pm to 9:00pm CST. 
                            We pretty much worked on the assignment together. I had the first 4 completed before the meeting and was able 
                            to compete exercises 4, 5 and 7. I was able to help with some of the group members but since I do have quite a bit more
                            experience with programming and specifically with javascript, I didn't want to answer all of the questions. I held back and 
                            let some of the other students teach and learn from each other. When the group seemed to get stuck for an extendend amount of time
                            I would step in and give some direction. 
                        </p>

                            Erin hosted the meeting using zoom and like last week she was a great tutor for the group.

                            I was having a hard time deciding on how to seperate my assignment and exercise pages from my main index page
                            so I have decided to create each example and assignment page as a seperate html page and then link an
                            iframe to it. This way I can include them in the body of my front end page and the user doesn't need to 
                            navigate away. I spent a lot more time on the css for the site and tried to make it more pleasant to use.
                        </p>
                        <h4 class="h-center">What am I going to do next?</h4>
                        <p> 
                            I will not go off on tangents but stick to the assignments. Going out of scope cost me too much time so I will be more 
                            strict when it comes to spending my time.
                        </p>

                        <p>  
                        I spent a lot of time on the Assignment this week. I ended up spending most of my time on Exercise 6.
                        I learned that Wikipedia has a great API, so I tried to get the Category: Boulevards in Paris page from the API. 
                        I was able to use the Javascript ajax functions to make calls to the Wiki web service but I couldn't get the actual page.
                        I finally followed the instructions and ran the code given to extract the array of links from the page using the console.
                        I then downloaded the log file after using console.log to record the array into the file. I then copied the array and 
                        pasted it into the Team Assignment code. After that I was able to quickly complete the exercise.

                        I was able to help with some of the debugging and hopefully I didn't teach any bad habbits.
                        I was very impressed with the last example that the teacher had created where he passed functions as arguments into the calculator function.
