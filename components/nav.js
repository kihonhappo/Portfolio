                            I already had Visual Studio Code installed on my pc and I have been using it since it first came out. 
                            I had no problem with intalling node.
                            I have not used Github so this is a good but challenging process. 
                            I was able to get it set up on mu Visual Studio Code editor.
                            I am having issues with updating my gitpages for my live portfolio site.

                            I set up Git Hub Account
                            I set up my Visual Studio Code and set it up to work with Git Hub.
                            I was able to publish the Portfolio hosted page to https://kihonhappo.github.io/Portfolio/.
                            I downloaded Team Viewer and set it up for my group meatings.
                            I read through the reading material but really enjoyed the Mobile First Videos.
                        </p>
                        <h4 class="h-center">What am I going to do next?</h4>
                        <p> 
                            I will build out my portfolio page links and start to record my notes and code examples in the subpages.
                            I will set up my css files to make my portfolio pages look nicer.

                        <h4 class="h-center">What are my blockers?</h4>
                        <p>  
                            One major blocker was that I did not read both of the anouncments and I missed the link and explanation for the Team Viewer site and group. 
                            I have a habit of quick scanning documentation and I am prone to missing important key elements. 
                            I will need to not do that when it comes to announcements.
                            I waited too late in the week to take a more detailed look at the assignments which tends to cause me stress.
                            I was planning on using vue.js framework as my basic code for my projects but then I read that you wanted us to do it from scratch. 
                            I have become so dependent on frameworks that I tend to get lazy when it comes to custom coding. This class will be good for me to brush up on my creative coding skills.

                        <p> In ch:2 concerning the primitive data types I noticed that there was a type that I have never heard of or used, the Symbol. 
                            I have been developing web applications since 2008 and haven't ran across it. 
                            I liked the tyepof special character if helps in cases where I am trying to automate the processing of data from multiple sources. 
                            I can use typeof to tell me if it is a string, number, boolean, undefined or null. I have used it to determine is an element is an object or an array as well. 
                        </p>
                          I have also noticed that there is a lot more push to use let and const. I still use var most of the time hopefully it will not go away.
                        </p>  
                        <p>    In ch3 I noticed that I need to study about sets, and Maps. 
                        </p>
                        <p>  
                            In ch4 I noticed that I don't like using arrow functions, they are challenging for me visually except for when I use a filter on an array. 
                            <p>

                                This would bring back the first object with a first name of Aaron. 
                                For some reason this makes sense to me visually.

                            I already had Visual Studio Code installed on my pc and I have been using it since it first came out.

                            I have not used Github so this is a good but challenging process. 
                            I was able to get it set up on mu Visual Studio Code editor.

                            I had to revamp my portfolio site to include much more content. 
                            I created a function in the portfolio site that checks if a localStorage item for link last clicked. 
                            If not storage item then the function defaults to the first week information. 
                            If there is a storage item then the function will get the content associated with the storage item. 
                            If a link is clicked then the localStorage will be set to the week selected and then the function injects the associated content into the web page. 
                            I was able to learn how to sync my VS code with Github to push site code to the repository. 
                            I was also able to update my Github pages. I added last weeks report and ninja example to my week 1 portfolio page. 
                            I had a successful Team meeting with my group. We were able to help each other with the Team Assignment.

                            I am going to complete the week 2 page of my portfolio and start on week 3 of my portfolio. 
                            I will spend more time on the exercises and do some extra reading.

                            Time is a blocker and timing is as well. 
                            It can be a bit discouraging to come home after work and then put in several hours of homework and then realize that my whole evening is gone. 
                            I need to read more on Sunday and Monday evening.

                        I was able to get it set up on mu Visual Studio Code editor.

                        We are Group 4 and we met on Wednesday 4/29/2021 from 8:00pm to 9:30pm CST. 
                        Our group members were: Aaron Ameny (me), Erin Engler, Joseph Watt and Catteara Neyman.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Erin helped us all with using Git as well as with the assignment.
                        I was able to help with some of the debugging and hopefully I didn't teach any bad habbits.
                        I was very impressed with the last example that the teacher had created where he passed functions as arguments into the calculator function.

                                We are Group 4 and we met on Wednesday 4/29/2021 from 8:00pm to 9:30pm CST. 
                                Our group members were: Aaron Ameny (me), Erin Engler, Joseph Watt and Catteara Neyman.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Erin helped us all with using Git as well as with the assignment.
                                I was able to help with some of the debugging and hopefully I didn't teach any bad habbits.
                                I was very impressed with the last example that the teacher had created where he passed functions as arguments into the calculator function.
